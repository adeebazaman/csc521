Description
In this project, you will be implementing the Quirk programming language, the language created for this class. This project is split into three parts:
lexer.py - Reads Quirk code and produces a sequence of tokens and token:lexeme pairs when appropriate. 
parser.py - Takes a sequence of tokens and produces a parse tree according to the language grammar. It is expected that this parser will be a recursive descent parser.
interpreter.py - The interpreter executes a program given a parse tree as input.

How to run the program
lexer.py <example.q
parser.py < example1.q

I also have example tokens for the parser to check if it is functional.
I dont have a functional interprter so it is not included.
