  Appears to be an error on line 30 due to the ui= sys.stdin[-1]
  But the code was there and it seems like it would work if this fatal bug was
  not there.

Parser: 22/30

  While the parser is not up to specifications. It does appears to work with
  the easier examples such as 1. It does not use stdin in a way that is was
  described in the homework write up.
